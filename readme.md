# Azure AD technical overview

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management service. This service helps your employees access external resources, such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications. 

Azure Active Directory also helps them access internal resources like apps on your corporate intranet network, along with any cloud apps developed for your own organization. For more information about creating a tenant for your organization, check out the [Create a new tenant in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) quickstart.
