## Blocking legacy authentication

Legacy authentication is a term that refers to an authentication request made by:

- Older Office clients that do not use modern authentication (for example, Office 2010 client)
- Any client that uses legacy mail protocols such as IMAP/SMTP/POP3

Legacy authentication does not support multi-factor authentication (MFA). Even if you have an MFA policy enabled on your directory, a bad actor can authenticate using a legacy protocol and bypass MFA. The best way to protect your account from malicious authentication requests made by legacy protocols is to [block these attempts altogether](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-block-legacy-authentication).
